        <h4>About the author</h4>
        <p>My name is Elyssa. I am a 33 year old mom and foster mom of (?) kids, (you'll have to play the game to find out!). My awesome husband is a JavaScript developer, and right now I stay at home, but as my kids are getting older, I plan on starting a career in iOS development.
        </p>
        <p>In the few moments of spare time that I have during the day, I love to read. I devour as many books as I can get my hands on. This year, I got a hammock for my birthday, and it is my new favorite reading spot. (though my sons usually pile on top of me the second I lay down in it).
        </p>
        <p>My next life goal is to move to Europe, to give my kids, (and myself), the experience of exploring other countries and cultures. Ideally, we will move to a small commuter town outside of London and travel at every given opportunity. I'm still in the "dreaming" phase of this life goal right now ,but hopeful that we can make it happen in the next year or two!
